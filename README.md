## Eclipse Origins
Legacy VB6 open-source ORPG engine discontinued in 2011

### About Eclipse Origins
Eclipse Origins was a modification of Mirage Source, an open-source ORPG made in VB6. It was designed to allow people with no programming knowledge to make their own online persistent world RPG.

Whilst flawed, it spawned a very strong development community that still runs today.

### How to use
Eclipse Origins was discontinued in 2011. As such, the best way to find resources you need is to use the Way Back Machine to find active pages on the original website from 2008 - 2011.
